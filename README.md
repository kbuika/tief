Okay, how do I explain this, I probably need therapy. If you've used [shadcn Blocks](https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks), there's a feature called `Lift Mode` that lets you copy only a section of block as opposed to selecting the entire block.

## How?

So now imagine that `Lift Mode` feature but now for all applications. You open a Browser Extension, Turn on `Lift Mode`, Sections on the page get highlighted and you can copy them and get code generated for the section.

### Is it even possible?

I really don't know. I am figuring out everything as I go.

### Isn't it easier to just take a screenshot and use [v0](https://v0.dev/)

I am sure it is. But is it fun? IS IT FUN? I don't think so.
